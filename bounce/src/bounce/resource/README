In this project, I took the base skeleton of Bounce
provided by Professor Wallace and added the following
features to the game:

1. A paddle that can be moved by the user using the 
'A' and 'D' keys. It can bounce the ball and prevent
it from colliding with the floor.

2. Green bricks that the ball can collide with. They
disappear upon collision.

3. Three levels that the player can advance through.
The number of bricks and the ball's speed increases
with each level.

4. Cheat codes that allow the player to skip levels.
The '1' key skips to level 1, the '2' key skips to 
level 2, and the '3' key skips to level 3. The '4'
key can give the player extra lives.

All graphics except the explosion were made by me in
photoshop. Sounds were taken from Star Wars.
